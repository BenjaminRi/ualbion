# ualbion
A remake of the 1996 RPG Albion (requires data from an install of the original game)

Prerequisites: .NET Core 3.0

See run.bat / run.sh for how to invoke dotnet to build and run it from the command line. Alternatively, open up the solution file with Visual Studio.
Configure data/config.json to set the path for the files from the original game (currently only version v1.38 where MAIN.EXE is 1,109,655 bytes is supported)
